				<ingredient>3 Boneless Skinless Chicken Breasts</ingredient>
				<ingredient>5 Cups Corn Flakes</ingredient>
				<ingredient>3/4 Cup All-Purpose Flour</ingredient>
				<ingredient>1/2 Teaspoon Salt</ingredient>
				<ingredient>1 Cup Milk</ingredient>
				<ingredient>6 Teaspoons Olive Oil</ingredient>
				<ingredient>12 oz Package Bowtie Noodles</ingredient>
				<ingredient>8 oz Package Cream Cheese</ingredient>
				<ingredient>1 Teaspoon Italian Seasoning</ingredient>
				<ingredient>1/4 Teaspoon Granulated Garlic</ingredient>
				<ingredient>1/2 Teaspoon Fresh Oregano</ingredient>
				<ingredient>1/4 Teaspoon Seasoned Salt</ingredient>
				<ingredient>1 Teaspoon Chicken Bullion Granuals</ingredient>
				<ingredient>1 Tablespoon Butter</ingredient>
				<ingredient>20 oz can Cream of Chicken Soup</ingredient>
				<ingredient>1 Cup Chicken Broth</ingredient>
			</ingredients-list>
			<directions>
				<step>In a small food processor crush the corn flakes into crumbs.</step>
				<step>Add the 1/2 t salt to the 3/4 C flour. Stir to combine.</step>
				<step>Place the flour, milk and crushed corn flakes each into their own separate pan. Loaf pans work well for this. If you don’t have three loaf pans, do not dismay. You could use pie tins, or round cake pans…what ever works for you.</step>
				<step>Place your chicken breasts in a gallon sized Ziploc bag and seal the top and pound the chicken flat with a meat mallet.</step>
				<step>Take a pair of sharp kitchen scissors and cut each breast in half.</step>
				<step>Dredge the chicken in the flour. Be sure it gets covered on both sides. Lay the floured chicken onto a small cookie sheet and slide the sheet into the freezer. Let it hang out there for about 5 minutes.</step>
				<step>Start cooking your pasta.</step>
				<step>Remove the chicken from the freezer and dredge each piece in the milk and then immediately into the corn flake crumbs. Again, be sure both sides are covered well.</step>
				<step>Add the olive oil to a hot skillet and Carefully lay each chicken piece into the hot oil. Sprinkle with a little bit of salt and pepper. Cook over medium high heat for about 5 minutes or until the underside of each piece is nice and golden brown. Turn the pieces over. If the bottom of the pan is dry add just a bit more olive oil to the side of the pan. Swirl the pan around a bit to let the oil flow to all sides.</step>
				<step>Cover the pan and reduce the heat to medium.  Let the chicken cook for about 7 more minutes, being careful not to burn the bottoms.</step>
				<step>When your chicken has been cooked through remove it from the pan and place it on a plate. Cover with tin foil.</step>
				<step>Grab 1 package cream cheese and place it in a small bowl. Pop it into the microwave for 30 seconds. Add 1 tsp Italian seasoning, 1/4 tsp granulated garlic, 1/2 tsp oregano, 1/4 tsp seasoned salt, 1 tsp chicken bullion granules. Stir it all in to combine.</step>
				<step>Slice your chicken into strips and serve over your cooked pasta and sauce. Garnish with chopped parsley if you choose.</step>

			<ingredient>1 Tablespoon All-Purpose Flour</ingredient>
		</ingredients-list>
		<directions>
			<step>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.</step>
			<step>Remove and discard the chicken giblets. Pat the outside dry. Liberally salt and pepper the inside of the chicken. Cut the lemons in quarters, place 2 quarters in the chicken along with the garlic and reserve the rest of the lemons. Brush the outside of the chicken with olive oil and sprinkle the chicken liberally with salt and pepper. Tie the legs together with kitchen string and tuck the wing tips under the body of the chicken. Place the chicken in a small (11 by 14-inch) roasting pan. (If the pan is too large, the onions will burn.) Place the reserved lemons and the sliced onions in a large bowl and toss with 2 tablespoons of olive oil, 1 teaspoon of salt, and 1/2 teaspoon of pepper. Pour the mixture around the chicken in the pan.</step>
			<step>Roast the chicken for about 1 hour and 15 minutes, until the juices run clear when you cut between a leg and a thigh. Remove the chicken to a platter, cover with aluminum foil, and allow to rest for 10 minutes while you prepare the sauce, leaving the lemons and onions in the pan.</step>
			<step>Place the pan on top of the stove and turn the heat to medium-high. Add the wine and stir with a wooden spoon to scrape up the brown bits. Add the stock and sprinkle on the flour, stirring constantly for a minute, until the sauce thickens. Add any juices that collect under the chicken. Carve the chicken onto a platter and serve with the lemons, onions, and warm sauce.</step>

			<ingredient>6 Boneless Skinless Chicken Breasts</ingredient>
			<ingredient>2 Sleeves Ritz Crackers</ingredient>
			<ingredient>Salt to Taste</ingredient>

			<ingredient>1 Cup Sour Cream</ingredient>

			<ingredient>2 Tablespoons Dried Parsley</ingredient>
			<ingredient>1/4 Teaspoon Dried Dill</ingredient>
			<ingredient>2 Teaspoons Parsley</ingredient>
			<ingredient>1 Can Cream of Chicken Soup</ingredient>
			<ingredient>2 Tablespoons Sour Cream</ingredient>
			<ingredient>3 Tablespoons Butter</ingredient>
		</ingredients-list>
		<directions>
			<step>Crush your Ritz crackers in a large ziptop bag.</step>
			<step>Trim your chicken breasts of fat and season well.  I used kosher salt, black pepper, and Italian seasoning.  Use whatever you prefer.</step>
			<step>Make yourself a "breading" station of sorts:  1.  Low fat sour cream or plain Greek yogurt.  2. Freshly grated sharp cheddar cheese.  3.  Crushed up Ritz crackers with the added dried parsley.</step>
			<step>Coat your chicken in the sour cream, then the cheese, and finally the crackers.</step>
			<step>Get as much or little of the cheese on the chicken as you would like.</step>
			<step>PRESS the cheddar coated chicken into the cracker crumbs until well coated. And the dried parsley in there look gorgeous!</step>
			<step> Set them on your baking sheet.  Here are some options.  I am using this silicone mat that has all of these little ridges.  It keeps the chicken raised up, allowing fats etc to run away from the meat while allowing the hot air to circulate underneath.  And nothing sticks to it.  You could also put your chicken on a cooling rack set into a sheet pan.  Other options?  Line your pan with parchment paper or aluminum foil.  OR... spray your sheet pan with nonstick spray.</step>
			<step>Bake 400 x about 35 min or until internal digital thermometer reaches 160 degrees.  The temperature of the meat will continue to rise to 165 when you remove from the oven.  Allow it to rest 5 minutes.</step>
			<step>Combine all the sauce ingredients and stir until hot.</step>

			<ingredient>1 Pound Angel Hair Pasta</ingredient>
		</ingredients-list>
		<directions>
			<step>This is how you make Chicken Piccata when you’re out of capers and you have a pathological fear of cooking anything without adding heavy cream.</step>
			<step>Have a pot of water simmering for the pasta.</step>
			<step>If chicken breasts are overly thick, pound until slightly flattened. Sprinkle with salt and pepper on both sides, then dredge in flour.</step>
			<step>Heat 2 tablespoons butter and 2 tablespoons of oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Fry two of the chicken breasts at one time until golden brown on both sides, about 3 minutes on each side; a little longer if breasts are thicker, a little shorter if breasts are thinner. Remove to a plate, then add the other 2 tablespoons each of butter and olive oil. Fry the other two breasts until golden, monitoring the oil/butter mixture to make sure it doesn't burn. Decrease heat as needed!</step>
			<step>After removing the chicken, have the heat on medium to medium-low. Pour in wine and chicken broth, and squeeze in the juice of two lemons. Whisk the sauce, scraping the bottom of the pan. Allow sauce to cook and bubble and thicken until reduced by about half. Sprinkle in a little salt and pepper as it's cooking.</step>
			<step>Reduce heat to low and pour in cream. Whisk together and allow to cook for a couple of minute until sauce thickens. Taste and adjust seasonings or other ingredients. Expect the sauce to have a real tang to it; counter it with a little more broth and cream if it's too strong! Sprinkle in some chopped parsley and stir.</step>
			<step>Right at the end, cook angel hair until al dente---do not overcook!</step>
			<step>With tongs, place a medium-sized mound of pasta on a plate. Place a cooked chicken breast beside it, then spoon sauce over the chicken and the pasta. The sauce is strong, so no need to drown it. Sprinkle a little minced parsley over the top.</step>
